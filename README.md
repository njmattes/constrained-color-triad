# Constrained color triads

This codebase generates groups of three colors that share value or
luminosity, and are maximally divergent with respect to hue, based on
constraints that the user provides for hues and values.

Everything is a bit of a mess, but a glance through the bottom of `main.py`
should orient you in the right direction.
